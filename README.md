# Calculator-Challenge.

For my week-2 challenge, on the nology software engineering course, I built an online calculator.
I accomplished this using HTML, CSS AND Javascript. Find the brief below.

We’re aiming for the following goals for this project:
1. A working Calculator: The main task is to create a Calculator not only will this test your 
understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem. 
2. Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible 
using git, GitHub and the command line.
3. Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been learning 
on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, use SCSS, 
BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!

Requirements
• PSEUDOCODE: Do it. Trust me, you will thank yourself.
• You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
o In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
o We expect at least 15 Git commits for the different stages in your development.
• Accept a minimum of 2 inputs, perform an operation and return the output.
• DO NOT USE THE eval() function as this is extremely dangerous
• Beware of following a “How to make a calculator in JS tutorial”. Watching a video is not 
the same as learning to code. Some of the stuff you’ll have to do we won’t have covered
but try your best to search to solutions to the next step of problem not the whole 
problem
• We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to 
work on different device widths.
• Normal rules for copying from online apply, if you can’t explain it, you can’t use it.
